Mindyolo Prune And Performance Testing
====================

About Prune
--------

   wellï¼Œthis may be the first code about mindyolo prune.Prune code maybe a lot about Pytorch,but in mindspore,there's none.I'm just a student,and make this just for my study.So ,there maybe a lot error,and it's performance may not satisfied you.But if want to give some suggestions, please refer to  `weiyuhao.nwpu.edu.cn@mail.nwpu.edu.cn `.
   Here is the details about how to prune yourself mindyolo model,but only yolov8.Because every version of the model ,its network structure isn't same.But you can do some fitness to your model.Other wise ,it's just a very easy Channel pruning
