Compared to Mindyolo, our project has the following improvements
1.change the logical of the draw_results function in mindyolo.utils.utils ,well compared to transmitting a image_path ,we choose to transfer a numpy array of imagesï¼Œand it makes it more efficient and convenient
2.Added val. py file to visualize a model in the form of a confusion matrix
3.Added demo/predict2.py file to enable the model to handle video streams
